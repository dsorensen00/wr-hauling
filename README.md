Commissioned to design and build a full stack application using a MERN tech stack to authenticate and track driver’s hours. Currently we are figuring out how we can implement authentication into the app through an NPM package called JWT. At the end of the project, driver’s will be able to log in and view a personalized window than the other drivers where they can log hours and view previous weeks. The admin may also have their own personalized window where they can view all drivers’ hours and view a single driver's log history.
